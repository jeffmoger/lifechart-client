      <h2>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>

      <p className="short">
        TL/DR: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and
        store your information.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar technologies (local storage) to access or
        store information. Specific information about how we use such
        technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our
        Cookie Notice.
      </p>

      <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

      <p className="short">
        TL/DR: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
        purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by
        law.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

      <p className="short">
        TL/DR: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
        organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
        third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
        collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only
        access the Website within a secure environment.

        If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
        you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note
        however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing
        before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your

        other than consent.
